# DECO1800-Team7
Project for an interactive wildlife-themed website

# Purpose & Motivation
The purpose of this website to teach children about animals in Australia, specifically ones from queensland. Animals are very important inhabitants in this shared world. By sparking curiosity in Children, we wanted them to have compassaion and empathy towards other inhabitants on this planet earth.


## Pitch 
Wildlife guide junior is an interactive and engaging platform for young students to learn about the wildlife here in Queensland. Students can learn about specific information about animals such as their endemicity and scientific names, this information is queried from API as per course requirement. We also provided an interactive map so students can see the distribution of a specific animal species. Last but not least, we included a video page so students can learn about animals through short videos. 


 Hi everyone, today we will be introducing our website : wildlife guide junior.


Project scope
 Our team have created an interactive website that provides educational information of the wildlife animals in Australia. Except for the learning from the classroom, we hope that the website could provide a fun, immersive learning experience for children. Also, we hope that this can be a useful educational platform for teachers to deliver their class in a more interesting way.


For the API, we have use the datasets from 
Target audience
Our main target audience is primary school students (7-12 years old) and teachers.


Success criteria:
To test whether we have achieve our project goals, we will be using surveys and doing interviews with teachers and students respectively. We hope that students can learn and able to understand the content about wildlife after browsing our website, being motivated and willing to learn more. For teachers, we hope that they will learn more about how to educate children in different ways through the articles in teacher mode. Also, using this website as a good tool in class to let the class become more engaging.




## API queries:
* Specific animal information are queried from Queensland WildNet API
* location information (animal sightings) are queried from Atals of Living Australia (these information are projected onto the map).
* Specie image is retrieved from Wikipedia API.

## Server side language jsutification:
PHP is used to dynamically generate content from queried information. If we were to used HTML to build a static website, there would be over 200 static pages. 



## Deisign considerations?
* colourful and eye catching for our target audience. 
* plenty of cartoon images and icons for children.

## why use these interactions ?
* the map is used to provide an straight forward way to visualise the distribution of animal habitats. 
* Quiz to add interactivity 
* short video to help student learn 

## why php over javascript ?
If we using HTML to do the website, we will have over 200 pages for many animal. Therefore, we use PHP to dynamic generate the web page.

## how do you justify using server side language over client side language

Implementation: API data from QLDWildenet, quiz/game, educative videos, Teacher mode
